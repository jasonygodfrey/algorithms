    """ Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. we have a range of possible k values: 1 to max(piles) (in the example above, it's 1 to 10)
2. we use binary search to find the minimum k that satisfies the condition
3. in each iteration, we calculate the total hours needed to eat all the bananas with k = (l + r) // 2
4. if the hours is less than h, we update the result and search in the left half of the range
5. if the hours is greater than h, we search in the right half of the range
6. the loop terminates when l > r """
